# Crack-Detection-in-Concrete
In this, i have trained a model which detects whether the given image of concrete has crack or not. Dataset of 40k images(20k images of concrete with crack and 20k images of concrete without crack) was used to train and test the model. CNN architecture used is very similar to Yann LeCun. Raw JPG images data was pre-processed and augmented with the help of ImageDataGenerator class from Keras. After training model was giving around 98% accuracy.
